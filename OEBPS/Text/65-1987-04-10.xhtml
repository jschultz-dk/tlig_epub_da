<h2>April 10, 1987</h2>
<p class="subtitle">Remember My Crucifixion</p>
<p>remember My Crucifixion lasted for hours; I suffered many hours; all of My Blood was shed; I love you; come and console Me by loving Me; </p>
<p><em>(Jesus was feeling sad, and was longing to be consoled. He constantly reminding me of His crucifixion these days and giving me images of it. Sometimes I feel His Presence so full that I think I could touch Him solidly, I could so to say feel the air moving when He moves producing it!) </em></p>
